Neo4j Koans
===========

This set of Koans will provide practical guidance for getting to grips with graph data structures and operations using the Neo4j open source graph database. It's part of a more comprehensive tutorial presented by the [authors](#authors) and others at conferences and tutorials. In fact anyone can take these materials freely and run their own tutorials.

Prerequisites
-------------

You'll need to be familiar with the Java programming language, and it'd be helpful if you understood unit testing too. All the graph database knowledge you'll needed will be developed as part of completing the Koans. 

Live Sessions
-------------

This tutorial is presented around the world. If you're interested in participating in a class, then it'll be taught at:

* Quarterly at [Skillsmatter](http://skillsmatter.com/course/nosql/neo4j-tutorial) London

* Once each in Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney at the [Yow! Australia 2012 conference](http://www.yowconference.com.au/YOW2011/general/workshopDetails.html?eventId=3488)
