This set of Koans will provide practical guidance for getting to grips with graph data structures and operations using the Neo4j open source graph database. It's part of a more comprehensive tutorial being developed by the [authors](#authors) which will make its way into conference tutorials soon enough.

Prerequisites
-------------

You'll need to be familiar with the Java programming language, and it'd be helpful if you understood unit testing too. All the graph database knowledge you'll needed will be developed as part of completing the Koans. 

Live Sessions
-------------
